# BigBot
BigBot is a discord selfbot made using python

# What is this?
Discord selfbots are kind of like normal discord bots, that
perform actions when given commands, but this does it on
a user account. This can help you do cool stuff like
send embed messages, send messages that ping people without
a ping, and other cool stuff.

# Is this safe?
The software itself is safe, I have all the code on here after all
for anyone to review. However, selfbots are against discord TOS so
use this carefully. I reccomend only showing friends you trust and 
not using this in public servers.

# Why is this actually so terrible
This is an alpha version, of course it is terrible

# I need help...
Just create an issue on this repository
